## UX
### Project Goals

This site has been created to provide users with a fully functioning e-commerce website for those interested in shopping for, and purchasing, wine online.
While this site has been created for eductional purposes only, the aim has been to provide an intuitive, user friendly, easy to navigate website that is clear and easy to understand for each step of the browsing and purchasing process and providing feeback to users along the way, each time an action is performed. 


### User Stories
##### As a user I want to:
1. view what products are available on this website
2. see all the wine products available
3. see all the details on any particular product and read more info about the product
4. look at different categories of wine rather than having them all display, ie. browse all the red wines only
5. have the option to sort the products in a number of different ways - by price, rating, country and by name
6. search the site for a specific wine
7. easily identify any special offers

### Design
#### Overall Design, Images and Color Scheme
* The aim with the design of this project is to provide the user with a clear, easy to navigate, visually appealing website. I choose the overall colour scheme to tie in with shades of wine - blush and red in particular and ended up going with less vivid colors to create a sense of a calm and a relaxing shopping experience, while also ensuring the colour scheme keeps focusing on showcasing the products.

* I used Bootstrap for much of the site layout and it's components, modals, navbar, footer, and card layout for the products. I feel it gives the user a well structured, well laid out design that provides a good user experience. 

* The main background image on the home page gives a nice simple introduction to the website, without taking centre stage. 

#### Typography
* I choose the Oswald font for the bulk of the website typography to provide a sense of sophistciation, with the Shadows into Light font for the logo and home page content and blog page content to create contrast using a more whimsical style.

### Features to implement in the future

There are a number of features that I would like to implement in the future to enhance the website both for the site owner and the user experience. 
* A special offers section for wines that are on sale and have a monthly offers section such as buy 6 bottles for the price of 5 etc. or free glasses with a purchase over a certain amount etc. Having a new offer on a monthly basis would enhance user experience and encourage repeat visits to the site and create more business on the site.
* Age Verification - an important feature for the site owner to have would be to add an age verification check to have the user confirm they are over 18 which is the legal age to purchase alcohol in Ireland
* Add the ability for registered users to upload blog posts they have written to feature on the site. Currently, only the admin can upload a new blog post. This would add to the user experience and have them more engaged with the content on the site. 
* I would also like to add the ability for registered users to leave comments on any blog post.
* Outside the time contraints of the course, I would also like to implement custom error pages. 
* Further security features would be important to ensure the integrity of the site in a real world application.

## Deployment

This project was developed using the Gitpod IDE and pushed to a Github repository with the use of Git version control. The project was then deployed using Heroku.

### To deploy to Heroku, the following steps were taken:

1. In advance of deployment, Heroku needs the requirements for the project. In Gitpod, create a requirements.txt file using the `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`. Then a Procfile needs to be created with the follwing code and no balnk like follwing it `web: gunicorn crushed_grapes.wsgi:application`. Push these files to your Github Repo.

2. Go to the [Heroku Website](https://id.heroku.com/login) and log in.

3. In the dashboard, select "Create New App".

4. Choose a unique app name and select the region appropriate to your location and click on 'Create App'.

5. When the app has been created, click on the "Resources" tab to provision a new Postgres database, using the free plan.

6. To use Postgres, return to your IDE and install `dj_database_url` and `psycopg2-binary` using the `pip3 install` command, making sure to add these to your requirements.txt file.

7. In `settings.py` comment out the default database setting and add the following code - 
`DATABASES = {'default' = dj_database_url.parse('database url')` - the database url can be found by going to the Heroku dashboard under the Settings tab, click on 'Reveal Config Vars', and copy the value next to 'DATABASE_URL'

8. Next, migrations need to be run again as we are now connecting to Postgres so run migrations using the `python3 manage.py migrate` command in the terminal.

9. To import all product data using fixtures we can load the categories data first, followed by the products data using the command `python3 manage.py loaddata categories` and `python3 manage.py loaddata products`.

10. Next, create a superuser for login with Heroku using `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`.

11. Before commiting to GitHub, the Database settings need to be changed in `settings.py` so that when the app is running on Heroku, it will connect to the Postgres database, otherwise, it will connect to the default SQLite DB, and ensuring the database url entered above in step 7 is removed and replaced with `parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))`

12. Add the host name of the Heroku app into "Allowed Hosts' in settings.py file

13. To enable automatic deployment, in the Heroku dashboard, go to the 'Deployment' tab, set the deployment to 'Github' and search for your repository. Click 'Connect' then 'Enable Automatic Deployments'

### Environment Variables 

1. Set the environment variables in Heroku under 'Settings' and 'Reveal Config Vars' 

| Key       | Value        | 
| --------- |:------------:| 
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID  | aws-access-key |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY  | aws-secret-access-key | 
| DATABASE_URL |   database-url-postgres   | 
| EMAIL_HOST_PASS | email-key |
| EMAIL_HOST_USER | host-email |
| SECRET_KEY | secret-key |
| STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | Stripe-public-key |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | Stripe-secret-key |
| STRIPE_WH_SECRET |Stripe-webhook-secret-key |
| USE_AWS | True |

2. Open S3 and click on "Create Bucket" which will be used to store static files and images.
3. Set the bucket name to match the name of your heroku app and select region closest to you. 
4. Ensure you select the followig settings - 
    + Uncheck 'Block Public Access settings for this bucket' and acknowledge any warnings as the bucket needs to be public in order to allow public access to our static files.
    + Object Ownership - ensure 'ACL's enabled' is checked along with 'Bucket Owner preferred'
    + Properties tab, turn on static website hosting
    + Permissions tab - paste in the following CORS configuration -

    + Copy the ARN from the bucket policy editor tab and paste in to ARN box
    + Click on 'Add Statement' and then 'Generate Policy'
    + Copy this policy into the bucket policy editor and before saving add '/*' onto the end of the resource key to allow full access to all resources in this bucket.

6. Go to the Access Control List section, click 'Edit' and enable 'List for Everyone (public access)' and accept the warning box and save.

7. Next search for IAM (Identity and Access Management) in the main search bar in AWS. 
    + Under 'Access Management' click on 'User Groups' to create a new group.
    + Give the group a name and click 'Create Group'
    + Under 'Access Management' click on 'Policies' and then 'Create Policy'.
    + Click on 'JSON' tab and select 'Import Managed Policy', search for S3 and import the full S3 access policy, then paste in the bucket ARN from the bucket policy page in S3 in the "Resource" section as below - 
```
 "Resource": [
     "your ARN",
     "your ARN/*"
 ]
```

8. Click 'Next' to go through to the nextpage and on to the 'Review Policy' tab and 'Create Policy'.

9. To attach the policy, click on "User Groups", select your group, go to the 'Permissions' tab, open the 'Add Permisssions dropdown, and click 'Attach policies'. Select the policy and click 'Add permissions' at the bottom.

10. Next, create a user: In the IAM dashboard, click on 'Users' and then 'Add User'. 
    + Set the user name, then select 'Programmatic access' under 'Access Type' and select 'Next'.
    + Select the group to add the user to, then click next, through to the end and click 'Create User'. 

11. Download the CSV file which will contain the user's access keys.


### Connecting Django to AWS

1. Install `boto3` and `django-storages` and add to requirements.txt
2. Add 'storages' to installed apps in settings.py
3. Add the following settings in settings.py
```
if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
    # Bucket Config
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'your-bucket-name'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'your-region'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'
