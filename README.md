## UX
### Project Goals

This site has been created to provide users with a fully functioning e-commerce website for those interested in shopping for, and purchasing, wine online.
While this site has been created for eductional purposes only, the aim has been to provide an intuitive, user friendly, easy to navigate website that is clear and easy to understand for each step of the browsing and purchasing process and providing feeback to users along the way, each time an action is performed. 


### User Stories
##### As a user I want to:
1. view what products are available on this website
2. see all the wine products available
3. see all the details on any particular product and read more info about the product
4. look at different categories of wine rather than having them all display, ie. browse all the red wines only
5. have the option to sort the products in a number of different ways - by price, rating, country and by name
6. search the site for a specific wine
7. easily identify any special offers
8. find out the delivery information ie. where the store delivers to and what the charges are
9. easily add any product to a shopping cart and have the cart hold these items while I continue to shop
10. view the contents of my shopping cart easily at any stage and see how much the running total is so I can keep track of how much I'm spending
11. easily checkout and complete my purchase by paying online securely
12. get an email confirmation of my order sent to me
13. read some interesting articles about wine and perhaps learn things I was not aware of
##### As a registered user I want to:
1. easily register for an account
2. receive an email confirmation when I register my account
3. have the site save my delivery info so I don't have to re-enter that each time I order
4. see my profile and be able to update my delivery details at any time
5. easily log in and see what I have purchased previously
6. easily log out
7. be able to reset my password if I forget it
##### As site owner/admin I want to:
1. easily add new products, make updates to existing products in the database and delete any product
2. encourage users to visit the site even if not planning a purchase
3. have all users confirm they are of legal age to drink alcohol (over 18) before making an order

### Content

All product images and detail content for the products database has been taken from external sources. I used 2 primary sources - 
1. [O'Brien's wine](https://www.obrienswine.ie/) website. Some images and almost all content on individual wines is from here. 
2. The second primary source was used mostly for images with some content also - [Vivino.com](https://www.vivino.com/IE/en/)

I also used a small number of images & product detail from [SuperValu.ie](https://shop.supervalu.ie/shopping/specialoffers/wine-beer-spirits/150200590) & [Tesco.ie](https://www.tesco.ie/groceries/product/browse/default.aspx?N=4294953032&Ne=4294954028)
