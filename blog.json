How do you choose a bottle you’ll love? Easy: just find an employee and tell them what you like. No need to use a long-winded French vocabulary. If you spot a wine you’ve enjoyed in the past, point it out and ask for something similar. Anytime you want to stray away from what you know, it’s good to do it gradually.\r\n\r\nHow about when you’ve been invited to a dinner party, and have no clue what’s on the menu. Fish or fowl? Red or white? Don’t stress. Simply bring something you’ve enjoyed before. Wine brings people together and a dinner party is a time to have fun. And if you really want something foolproof? It’s hard to go wrong with a nice Pinot Noir.\r\n\r\nThen there’s that most daunting of wine moments: you’re at a restaurant and the waiter hands over a fat book with page after page of exotic-sounding bottles. Don’t be afraid to ask for the sommelier and take advantage of their expertise.\r\n\r\nOnce you’ve started your wine education, keep going. If you’re getting into wine, read about vineyards. Beyond that? Find a special bottle, and read about its back story as you enjoy a glass.\r\n\r\nAbove all, ask lots of questions. Wine shop owners, sommeliers, bartenders: they’ve all been exactly where you are.", "image": "wine-bottles.webp", "date_added": "2022-02-12T09:58:04.474Z"}}, {"model": "blog.blog", "pk": 2, "fields": {"title": "Food & Wine Pairings - the cheat's guide!", "body": "An ultimate culinary combo, pairing wine with food has been around for centuries. There’s no doubt a glass of wine with dinner can elevate your dining experience, but how can you nail this art of finding the perfect pairing?\r\n\r\nFor all foodies—and even casual wine drinkers—pairing a nice glass of wine with a delicious plate of food can be the combination that sends your taste buds into orbit. But how do you do it? There are general rules of thumb and more nuanced ones as well. Let’s start with some basics:\r\n\r\n\r\nChoose a Wine That you Like\r\nIt’s important that you pair your food with a wine that you’ll actually like. If you usually don’t do white wines, you probably won’t like a glass of it with food. Stick to what you enjoy and branch out from there. \r\n \r\n\r\nBalance it Out\r\nWine and food need to balance each other out, with neither one overwhelming the taste of the other. This doesn’t mean doing opposite pairings—rather,  pair equal flavors to create a good balance. Think a bold red wine with a hearty plate of lamb or a light-bodied white wine with grilled fish for a delectable, delicate experience. Sometimes, opposite flavors can work together, like a sweet Riesling with fried rice.\r\n\r\n\r\nPair Wine with the Main Flavor\r\nWhen doing wine pairings, match the wine to the most prominent element of the dish. This could be the seasonings, sauce, or the main ingredient. For instance, chicken in a sauce with mushrooms has an earthier, richer flavor—so it’ll need red wine, but grilled chicken with a creamy lemon sauce would pair well with a white. That’s why most wine connoisseurs recommend pairing wine with the sauce of the dish instead of the meat. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n6 Flavor Profiles To Consider When Pairing Wine\r\nYou got the basics down, but now comes the more nuanced part. When it comes to food and wine, there are six main flavor profiles to keep in mind:\r\n\r\nAcidic\r\nFatty\r\nBitter\r\nSalty\r\nSweet\r\nAlcohol\r\nEach profile can be mixed and matched with another to create excellent wine pairing combos. For example, you can try a bitter, tannic wine with sweet food or to cut through fatty dishes. These flavor profiles & wine pairings will come in handy for dinner, special celebrations, or around the holidays.\r\n\r\nQuick Wine Facts:\r\nRed wines have more bitterness.\r\n\r\nWhite and Rosé wines have more acidity.\r\n\r\nSweet wines have mostly sweet notes.", "image": "food-and-wine_KoqsJFe.webp", "date_added": "2022-02-12T10:18:07.286Z"}}, {"model": "blog.blog", "pk": 4, "fields": {"title": "Blog Test 4", "body": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
